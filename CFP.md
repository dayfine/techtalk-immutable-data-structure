Immutable or Persistent DS is a broad concept that ties to functional programming, which as many know, is a very popular trend in the recent year.

Just as pure functions entail so side-effect except producing an output from input, a immutable data strcuture cannot be changed or mutated, but any updates or modification will create a new variable with the new value - Just like a Redux Store!

In this talk I will go over:

1. What is the benefits of using immutable data structure, for both practical and therotical reasons
2. How are immutable data structures implemented in JavaScript
3. How to use them in your React Apps

It's really fun! Check it out!
